## Final Analysis: 
> Most althletes in the olympics reside from countries like the United States of America, Japan and Australia. This could be because these countries promote sports and athletics from a younger age, hone the youth and prepare them to compete in such higher levels and invest more behind these. Unlike countries like Tanzania or Sudan, these countries probably have a better sports culture.
___
> Athletics is the most popular discipline in the Olympics. This could be because other sports like football/basketball get other stages for players to display their merits so probably this is why athetes performing in athletics try to display their abilities in this grand stage.
___
> Japan produces the most coaches and US after them. Again this could be because of the vast culture of sports in these nations and as athletes grow preparing from a much younger age, they gain a lot of experience, resultingly becoming coaches.
 ___

> Females participate in all the disciplines but comparatively less than men. This cannot be because of any kinds of discrimination, rather the lack of growth of mindsets in young women to become great athletes someday in comparison to men. But, surely this statistic has developed a lot in the past years and some day, women might dominate more in these stages too.
___
>USA has highest number of gold, silver and bronze medals and this shows how succesful the US is. The biggest reason could be wealth; more investment on athletes and their respective disciplines. Having better coaches and facilities does help create better and improved athletes so wealth could probably be why USA does so much better than other countries.
